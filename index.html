      <strong>Description:</strong> As a cultural volunteer, I had the honor of choreographing a dance performance for children under 7 years at CHAA (Canada Havyaka Associations) in April 2023.

Through innovative solutions and the dedication of the participants, we successfully brought the dance to life, creating a joyful cultural experience for the children. This experience reinforced my belief in the power of volunteerism to bridge gaps and bring communities together, even in the face of logistical challenges.
